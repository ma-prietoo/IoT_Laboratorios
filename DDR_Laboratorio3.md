# 1. System Overview

* **System Type:** [ ] Component (Lab 1-2) | [x] System (Lab 3-6) | [ ] Environment (Lab 7-8)

* **Description:**

This DDR documents the complete results from:

- Lab 1: RF Characterization
- Lab 2: 6LoWPAN Mesh Networking & Resilience
- Lab 3: Efficient Data Transport with CoAP and CBOR

The project validates IEEE 802.15.4 communication using ESP32-C6 devices and OpenThread, then extends that Thread mesh with a compact ASD sensor-service contract for `/env/temp` using CoAP/UDP, CBOR, and Observe.

# 2. Lab Log & Stakeholder Summaries

# LAB 1 — RF Characterization

## To Samuel (Architect)

The radio behavior of the ESP32-C6 using OpenThread was empirically validated. The cleanest channel found was channel 23, with an energy level of -108 dBm during the scan.

The link was completely stable up to 10 m, with 0% packet loss. At 20 m, communication was still achieved, but packet loss increased to 20%. From 25 m and 30 m onwards, packet loss was high, between 31% and 52%, meaning the link can no longer be considered reliable for a sensor network that requires high availability.

Conclusion: the ESP32-C6 works correctly for short-range Thread communication, but based on the obtained data, a practical maximum spacing of around 10 m is recommended to ensure reliability.

---

## To Edwin (Ops)

The network operated correctly when both nodes used the same channel. The configured channel was 23. If a node does not join the network or does not respond to ping, the first thing to check is that the `dataset channel` matches on both devices.

It was also observed that as distance increases, `NoAck` errors appear, meaning that a packet was sent but no acknowledgment was received from the other node. This typically occurs due to weak signal, obstacles, antenna orientation, interference, or excessive distance.

Recommendation: keep the nodes at a maximum distance of 10 m for reliable testing in indoor environments or in environments with uncontrolled interference.

---

# LAB 2 — 6LoWPAN Mesh Networking & Resilience

## To Samuel (Architect)

A multi-hop Thread mesh network was successfully formed using three ESP32-C6 nodes.

Topology:

A (Leader) → B (Intermediate Router) → C (Final Router)

The routing path was validated using:

```bash
ot neighbor table
ot router table
```

Node A could not directly communicate with node C and required node B as forwarding router.

A Tractor Test was performed by disconnecting node B during continuous ping transmission. Communication temporarily failed and automatically recovered after the router rejoined the mesh.

Measured convergence time:

- Approximately 64 seconds

Result:

- PASS (< 120 seconds requirement)

The average RTT increased during multi-hop operation, but latency remained acceptable for actuator-control applications.

---

## To Edwin (Ops)

The network automatically detected when the intermediate router failed. During the Tractor Test, node B was physically disconnected, interrupting communication between A and C.

OpenThread logs showed:

```text
error:NoAck
```

After reconnecting the router, the network automatically rebuilt the routing path and communication resumed without reflashing or manual reconfiguration.

Measured convergence time:

```text
Approximately 64 seconds
```

Recommendation:

Thread mesh networking should be preferred over star topologies for agricultural deployments because the network can automatically recover from node failures.

# LAB 3 — Efficient Data Transport (CoAP & CBOR)

## To Daniela (Customer)

One sensor reading became much smaller on the radio side. The measured CoAP/CBOR exchange used a six-byte payload and an estimated `~36 B` compressed Thread/6LoWPAN on-wire cost, while the earlier HTTP/JSON exchange costs about `~500 B`; for one reading, CoAP is therefore about `14x` smaller than HTTP.

Observe also kept the radio from being awakened by constant application polling. During a measured `342.534 s` window, Node B received one initial Observe response and `29` change notifications, while a `1 Hz` polling client would have sent about `343` GET requests; after subscription, that is about `5.08` threshold notifications per minute instead of `60` polling GETs per minute, reducing repeated application exchanges by about `91.55%` and improving battery endurance for SoilSense nodes.

# 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

# LAB 1 — ADRs

## ADR-001: Selection of Channel 23 for the Thread Network

### Context

The Thread network operates over IEEE 802.15.4 in the 2.4 GHz band. This band can also be used by WiFi and other devices, so before creating the network, a channel with low interference must be selected.

An energy scan was performed using:

```bash
ot scan energy 500
```

### Decision

Channel 23 was selected to operate the Thread network.

### Rationale

Channel 23 showed the lowest detected energy level during the scan, at:

```text
-108 dBm
```

A more negative value indicates lower interfering energy on that channel.

# LAB 2 — ADRs

## ADR-002: Choosing Thread Mesh Instead of LoRaWAN Star Topology

### Context

The agricultural deployment requires:

- low-latency actuator control,
- resilience,
- communication continuity,
- and automatic recovery after node failure.

### Decision

Thread mesh networking was selected instead of LoRaWAN star topology.

### Rationale

Thread mesh networking provides:

- self-healing,
- multi-hop routing,
- IPv6 native communication,
- and local device-to-device communication.

LoRaWAN offers very long range but depends on a centralized gateway.

If the gateway fails, communication is interrupted.

Thread routing allows packets to travel dynamically through intermediate routers.

This behavior was experimentally validated during the Tractor Test.

### Status

* **Status:** [ ] Proposed | [x] Accepted | [ ] Deprecated

# LAB 3 — ADRs

## ADR-003: Use CoAP/UDP + CBOR for the Sensor Uplink

### Context

SoilSense sensor nodes operate over a constrained Thread mesh. HTTP/JSON from Lab 0 carries TCP setup and text payload overhead, and MQTT/JSON from Lab 0.5 still depends on a TCP connection, broker round trips, and keepalive traffic. Lab 3 requires a documented application resource that supports compact reads and push-on-change behavior for temperature data.

### Decision

Use CoAP over UDP on port `5683` with the ASD resource `/env/temp`, a CBOR payload encoded as `{"t": float16}`, and `GET + Observe` for change-driven updates.

### Rationale

The documented `/env/temp` contract returns `application/cbor` Content-Format `60` and an always-six-byte body with the wire form `A1 61 74 F9 hh ll`. In Task C, the measured payload was `6 B`, the CoAP message was `26 B`, and the compressed Thread/6LoWPAN exchange was estimated at `~36 B`, compared with `~500 B` for HTTP/JSON and `~40 B` for a MQTT/JSON publish on an already-open TCP socket.

MQTT was not selected for the radio side because its apparently competitive bytes per reading hide the cost of a maintained TCP socket, TCP/MQTT startup, keepalives, and broker-mediated communication. CoAP can send a reading as one UDP datagram and Observe avoids repeated polls.

## Functional Viewpoint

The Lab 2 Thread mesh belongs to the Sensing and Controlling Domain (SCD), but its behavior is described more precisely by functional responsibilities than by node roles alone.

| Functional Component | Lab 2 Element | Function in the SCD | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Network Management | Leader role on Node A | Coordinates the Thread network, maintains dataset state, and participates in router allocation. | `ot state`, active dataset, leader logs |
| Routing and Forwarding | Router role on Node B | Forwards IPv6 packets through the mesh and rebuilds reachability when the route changes. | neighbor table, router table, Tractor Test |
| Sensing/Control Endpoint | Final Thread node / child-capable device | Represents the field endpoint that must remain reachable for sensing or control traffic. | ping reachability and recovery test |
| Communication Interface | IEEE 802.15.4 + 6LoWPAN + Thread | Carries compressed IPv6 traffic among SCD devices over the low-power radio link. | OpenThread communication tests |

This Functional Viewpoint separates the ISO/IEC 30141 responsibilities that were previously described only as Leader, Router, and Child roles. The Leader is not a separate domain: it implements network-management behavior inside the SCD. The Router implements routing and forwarding in the same domain, while the endpoint represents the sensing or control participant that depends on the communication subsystem.

## Application Service Contract - Lab 3

| Contract Field | Lab 3 Definition |
|---|---|
| Resource | `/env/temp` |
| Transport | CoAP / UDP / port `5683` |
| Methods | `GET`, `GET + Observe` |
| Content-Format | `60` (`application/cbor`) |
| Observe policy | Notify when `|new - last_notified| > 0.5 C`; heartbeat freshness support remains available through Max-Age behavior |
| Success response | `2.05 Content` |
| Path mismatch | `4.04 Not Found` |
| Unsupported method | `4.05 Method Not Allowed` |

CBOR payload byte layout:

```text
A1            map(1)
61 74         text(1) "t"
F9 hh ll      float16, big-endian, IEEE 754 half-precision
```

CDDL schema:

```cddl
env-reading = {
  t: float16   ; air temperature, degrees Celsius
}
```

## Protocol Stack Mapping - Lab 3

| Layer | Protocol / Artifact | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Application service | CoAP `/env/temp` + Observe | Exposes GET and push-on-change sensor reads |
| Application data | CBOR + CDDL | Encodes and documents the temperature body |
| Transport | UDP | Carries each CoAP exchange without a TCP session |
| Network adaptation | IPv6 + 6LoWPAN IPHC | Preserves IP reachability while compressing headers |
| Mesh network | Thread / OpenThread | Supplies mesh addressing, routing, and node roles |
| Link / radio | IEEE 802.15.4 on ESP32-C6 | Transmits the constrained low-power frames |

CoAP carries application sensor data while Thread MLE handles leader election and routing maintenance, keeping the functional data plane separate from Thread management.

## Lab 3 Technical Checks

### Task A - API Live Check

Node B requested:

```text
ot coap get fdbd:7c61:21f8:1952:6ff6:6b9d:55aa:cf5d env/temp
```

One observed payload was:

```text
a1 61 74 f9 4e 1c
```

The prefix `A1 61 74 F9` matches the published CBOR contract for a one-entry map with key `t` and a float16 value, so the live response conforms to `/env/temp`.

### Task B - Observe vs Polling

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---:|
| Observe start | `08:27:35.661371`, `OBS=78` |
| Observe final response | `08:33:18.195202`, `OBS=107` |
| Observe duration | `342.534 s` |
| Observe responses visible, including subscription response | `30` |
| Threshold notifications after subscription response | `29` |
| Heartbeat notifications visible in measured window | `0` |
| Polls at `1 Hz` over same duration | `343` |
| Threshold notifications / polling GETs | `29 / 343 = 8.45%` |
| Repeated application exchange reduction | `91.55%` |

### Task C - Efficiency Audit

| Stack | One-reading exchange | Bytes on the wire | Packets | vs CoAP |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **HTTP / JSON** (Lab 0) | TCP SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK + GET + 200 OK + FINx2 | **~500 B** | 6 | 14x |
| **MQTT / JSON** (Lab 0.5) | PUBLISH with an already-open TCP socket | **~40 B** | 1* | 1.1x |
| **CoAP / CBOR** (Lab 3) | One UDP datagram | **~36 B** (measured payload: `6 B`) | 1 | 1x |

| CoAP Cost Element | Bytes |
|---|---:|
| Fixed CoAP header | 4 |
| OpenThread CLI token | 4 |
| Uri-Path `env` | 4 |
| Uri-Path `temp` | 5 |
| Content-Format option | 2 |
| Payload marker | 1 |
| Measured CBOR payload | 6 |
| **Total CoAP message** | **26 B** |
| UDP header | 8 |
| Approximate compressed IPv6 after 6LoWPAN IPHC | ~2 |
| **Estimated compressed on-wire total** | **~36 B** |

* MQTT counts one packet per reading after connection setup, but startup connection traffic and periodic keepalives remain part of the radio energy budget.

# 5. First Principles Reflections

# LAB 1

#### 1. Why does the signal weaken as distance increases?

A radio signal propagates as an electromagnetic wave. As it moves away from the transmitter, its energy spreads over a larger area. Therefore, the received power decreases with distance. In free space, this decay can be approximated by a quadratic relationship: if the distance is doubled, the received power decreases significantly.

In practical terms, as the nodes move farther apart, the receiver gets a weaker signal. If the signal becomes too close to the noise floor or environmental interference, retransmissions, higher delays, and packet loss occur.

#### 2. Why does a greater distance lead to higher packet loss?

As distance increases, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. This means the receiver has more difficulty distinguishing useful information from background noise. When the receiver cannot correctly decode a packet, it does not send an acknowledgment (ACK). In the tests, this was observed with messages such as:
```text
MeshForwarder: Failed to send IPv6 ICMP6 msg ... error:NoAck
```
This message indicates that the node attempted to transmit, but did not receive confirmation from the other end. As a result, the packet loss percentage increases.

#### 3. Why is IEEE 802.15.4 used instead of WiFi for sensors?

IEEE 802.15.4 is designed for low-power, low-data-rate networks. For agricultural or battery-powered sensors, this is more suitable than WiFi. WiFi can provide higher data rates but consumes more energy. In a sensor network, high speed is usually not required; instead, stability, low power consumption, and the ability to operate for long periods are more important.

#### 4. What does selecting the channel with the lowest RSSI mean?

In an energy scan, RSSI indicates how much energy is detected on each channel. This energy can come from other devices, noise, or interference. A more negative value, such as -108 dBm, indicates a cleaner channel. That is why channel 23 was a good choice.

# LAB 2

#### 1. Why does mesh networking improve resilience?

In a mesh topology, packets can travel through intermediate routers instead of depending on a single gateway. If one node fails, the routing tables can eventually adapt and establish another communication path.

This makes the network more fault tolerant than a star topology.

---

#### 2. Why does multi-hop communication increase latency?

Every hop introduces additional:

- transmission delay,
- processing delay,
- ACK waiting time,
- and MAC-layer contention.

Therefore:

```text
More hops → Higher RTT
```

This behavior was experimentally observed during the laboratory.

---

#### 3. Why do routers consume more energy?

Routers must keep their radios active continuously in order to:

- listen for packets,
- maintain neighbor tables,
- forward traffic,
- and participate in routing.

This consumes more energy than sleepy end devices.

---

# LAB 3

#### 1. Why can CoAP use UDP where HTTP cannot?

CoAP can use UDP where HTTP cannot because its request, response, retransmission, and resource semantics are designed for constrained datagrams instead of depending on a persistent TCP stream.

#### 2. Why does Observe save battery compared with `GET every 60 s`?

Observe saves battery because the sensor sends application data only when a subscribed resource changes or needs a freshness notification, instead of waking for unnecessary polling requests.

#### 3. Why is CBOR not a custom binary format?

CBOR is not a custom binary format because it is a standardized data representation with defined types and a publishable CDDL schema that lets other implementations decode the payload.

# 7. Ethics & Sustainability Checklist

- [x] *Lab 1:* Verified that interference did not disrupt other groups.
- [x] *Lab 1:* Passive energy scans were used.
- [x] *Lab 2:* Resilience tests did not intentionally interfere with other groups.
- [x] *Lab 2:* Router was disabled after testing to reduce spectrum occupation and save energy.
- [x] *Lab 3:* Observe reduced traffic from `343` hypothetical `1 Hz` polling GETs to `29` threshold notifications after the initial subscription response, a reduction of about `91.55%`.
- [x] *Lab 3:* The `/env/temp` resource contract, CBOR byte layout, Content-Format, and CDDL schema are documented so another client can decode the reading.

## Lab 3 Energy Calculation

The measured post-subscription Observe rate is:

```text
Observe rate = 29 threshold notifications / 342.534 s
             = 0.08466 notifications/s
             = 5.080 notifications/min
```

The local course `references.md` reviewed for this laboratory did not state a radio-RX value, so this estimate uses the ESP32-C6 datasheet value for IEEE 802.15.4 active receive current:

```text
I_RX = 74 mA
```

If CoAP saves `50 ms = 0.05 s` of radio time for each delivered reading:

```text
readings/year = 0.08466 readings/s x 31,536,000 s/year
              ~= 2,670,000 readings/year

saved time/year = 2,670,000 x 0.05 s
                ~= 133,500 s
                ~= 37.08 h

saved charge = 74 mA x 37.08 h
             ~= 2,744 mAh/year
```

At the measured Observe notification rate, saving `50 ms` of radio time per transmission preserves about `37.08 h` of RX radio-on time or about `2.74 Ah` of battery charge over one year. The exact added operating lifetime depends on the selected battery capacity and the rest of the node power budget.

# 10. Final Analysis

## Lab 1 - RF Characterization

The RF characterization validated the operation of the ESP32-C6 radio with OpenThread before building larger IoT behavior on top of it. Channel 23 was selected because it presented the lowest measured interference during the scan, at `-108 dBm`.

Under the tested conditions, the ESP32-C6 communication link was reliable up to approximately 10 m. As distance increased, packet loss and RTT increased because the received signal became weaker and retransmissions became more likely. This laboratory established the practical importance of channel selection and radio characterization before deploying a sensor network.

## Lab 2 - 6LoWPAN Mesh Networking and Resilience

Lab 2 extended the radio link into a resilient Thread mesh using ESP32-C6 devices and OpenThread. A forced multi-hop topology was validated through neighbor and router tables so that communication depended on an intermediate router instead of a direct path.

The Tractor Test demonstrated self-healing behavior. When the intermediate router failed, communication was interrupted; after the router rejoined, OpenThread rebuilt the routing path and restored connectivity automatically. The measured convergence time was approximately:

```text
64 seconds
```

This result satisfies the laboratory recovery requirement and supports the decision to use Thread mesh behavior for local agricultural device communication.

## Lab 3 - Efficient Data Transport with CoAP and CBOR

Lab 3 moved the temperature uplink from heavier application exchanges toward a constrained-service interface. The `/env/temp` resource was documented as an ASD contract and validated live through `coap get` responses whose CBOR body followed the six-byte `A1 61 74 F9 hh ll` layout.

CoAP/CBOR reduced one estimated compressed Thread/6LoWPAN reading to `~36 B`, about `14x` smaller than the earlier `~500 B` HTTP/JSON exchange. Observe also reduced repeated application traffic in the measured window: after the initial subscription response, `29` threshold notifications replaced `343` hypothetical `1 Hz` polling GETs, a reduction of about `91.55%`.

The measured CoAP round-trip latency averaged about `44 ms`, below the `< 200 ms` target for one hop. These results support ADR-003: CoAP/UDP + CBOR is a better radio-side sensor uplink than HTTP/JSON and avoids the TCP socket, keepalive, and broker costs that make MQTT less attractive on the constrained radio path.
